 * easy/medium* - graph - leetcode - find judge
 * @link https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/description/
 * @description
 * In a town, there are (n) people labeled form 1 to (n). There
 * is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.
 *
 * If the town judge exists, then:
 *  - the town judge trusts noone.
 *  - everybody (except the judge) trusts the town judge.
 *  - there is exactly one person that satisfies 1 and 2.
 *
 * You are given an array [trust] where [trust][i] = [a, b],
 * representing that person-a trusts person-b.
 *
 * Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists,
 * and can be identified, otherwise return -1.
 * @summary
 * - inDegree of node: # of edges going into the node.
 * - outDegree of node: # of edges going away from the node.
 * - the judge node will have an inDegree = 0; outDegree = n-1
 * - where n is # of nodes.
 *
 * - quick steps::
 * -- initate two arrays w/ zeros @ length n+1
 * -- increment in + out-degree arrays
 * -- loop find if judge criteria is met: out=0, in=n-1
 * @param n
 * @param trust
 * @returns
